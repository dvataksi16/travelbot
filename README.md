## Follow this branching methodology

First Time 
1. Clone repository 
2. Create a new branch --> > git branch -b newbranchname 

#2 --> Creates a new branch for you and automatically switches you in to that working branch. Make sure you are always in your branch doing work and NOT master 

To check to see what branch you are in ... > git branch 

To make changes to your branch 
git add . (add the files individually and always avoid adding the iosfinal2018/iosfinal2018.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj to avoid our different Team Name problem)
git commit -am "message"
git push origin branchname
